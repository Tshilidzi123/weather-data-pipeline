# üå¶Ô∏è South Africa Weather Data Engineering Pipeline

## üìò Project Overview
This project is an **end-to-end data engineering pipeline** that automatically collects, transforms, and visualizes **7-day weather data** for major cities in **South Africa**.  
It uses open-source weather APIs, Python for ETL, MySQL for storage, and Power BI for reporting.

The goal is to simulate a **real-world data engineering workflow** ‚Äî from data ingestion to visualization ‚Äî using reproducible, automated processes.
